Some of the SharePoint add-ins (formerly called "apps for SharePoint") in this package are configured as "autohosted". The autohosted preview has been discontinued. These sample add-ins still work when debugged with F5 in Visual Studio. To actually deploy a sample in SharePoint, you will need to make a small change in the appmanifest.xml file. Replace the <AutoDeployedWebApplication> element and all its child elements with this string: "<RemoteWebApplication ClientId="*" />"
